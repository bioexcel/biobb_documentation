    "\n",
    "**Jupyter Notebook** (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook documents. The *notebook* term can colloquially make reference to many different entities, mainly the Jupyter web application, Jupyter Python web server, or Jupyter document format depending on context. A **Jupyter Notebook** document is a JSON document, following a versioned schema, and containing an ordered list of **input/output cells** which can contain code, text (using Markdown), mathematics, plots and rich media, usually ending with the \".ipynb\" extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook can be converted to a number of open standard output formats (**HTML**, **presentation slides**, **LaTeX**, **PDF**, **ReStructuredText**, **Markdown**, **Python**) through *Download As* in the web interface, via the nbconvert library or *jupyter nbconvert* command line interface in a shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "To simplify visualisation of **Jupyter Notebook** documents on the web, the nbconvert library is provided as a service through NbViewer which can take a URL to any publicly available notebook document, convert it to **HTML on the fly** and display it to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic examples of **Jupyter Notebook** execution for *biobb_template* can be found here:\n",

    "\n",
    "The execution is pretty straightforward: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We must **create an object** with the tool **properties** in case the properties are mandatory for this tool. More information about the properties [clicking here](https://biobb-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/arguments.html#properties).\n",
    "\n",
